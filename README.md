# MyBlog:

## This blog is going to be replaced by Hacking-News, but I still think this code is cool, so I'm going to make the repository public

> Status: Version 1.0.0 ðŸš€

I had an interesting idea to make a technology blog with the things I've been learning recently, I still don't know if I'm really going to write posts and everything else or if it's just another study project, it will depend on my will :)

## Technologies:
- React.js
- Next.js (with SSG and ISR)
- styled-components
- ESlint
- MongoDB (store post data)
- Node.js
- TypeScript

**Blog with Next.js, Typescript and MongoDB**
